# Ecommerce System

## Overview
Hello , this was my second project during my journy to be a software engineer, i've been coding lots of projects so far and they still under development , anyways this is not a compelete Ecommerce System but it's just the begining , as i'm still beginner , the project is simple , it uses Json Files to Store the data and manipluate it in different parts in the programe

# Key Point

- Users Can Login / register in the System
- an Admin user Can Have a heigher Privileges than a normal user (ie. Add a new Product , mainpulates the database...and so on)
- The Database is just a json files there're three
  1- A Json file for Products
  2- A Json file for Users registered in the System
  3- A Json file represents the current user who uses the system (parallel usage is not supported yet)

# Why
The reason of doing that project that i'm trying to achieve a goal , which is making # of projects in this summer as a practical practice on the OO concepts.

## What I Have Learned
Working with Java Swing Library for the first time is absolutoly wonderfull , so i learned some of it's main principles , how it works and I also learned the logic behind the GUI Application in general.
Also , learning the Ability of Reading / Writing And Manibulating Json files was such a greate experience
