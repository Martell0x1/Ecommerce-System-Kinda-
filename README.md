# Ecommerce System

## Overview
Hello,

This Project marks my second venture in my journey to becoming a software engineer , Throughout this journey , I have developed numerous projects , many of which are still in progress , While this is not a compelete eCommerce system , it represents the initial steps of its development.As I am still a beginner,the project is intentionally simple,it utilizes the JSON files for data storageand manipulation across various parts of the programe

# Key Point

- Users Can Login / register into the System
- We Are Planning To introduce a new Feature that will distinguish bewtween two types of users: normal user and an admin user. The admin user is granted higher privileges compared to the normal user (ie.Adding new users , removing new users , manipulating the packages database and so on),ensuring enhanced capabilities and access to advanced features , this inhancement aims at improving the overall functionality and user experience of out system.
- The Database is just a json files there're three
  1- A Json file for Products
  2- A Json file for Users registered in the System
  3- A Json file represents the current user who uses the system (parallel usage is not supported yet)

# Why
The reason of doing that project that i'm trying to achieve a goal , which is making # of projects in this summer as a practical practice on the OO concepts.

## What I Have Learned
Working with Java Swing Library for the first time is absolutoly wonderfull,I learned some of it's main principles,How it works and I also the logic behind the GUI Applications in general.
Also,learning the Ability of Reading / Writing And Manibulating JSON files was such a greate experience
